# porick

Porick is an IRC quotes application, intended to provide a more modern interface to quotes stored in a "Chirpy!"
database. 

It was originally written using the Pylons framework, but has now been re-written using flask, and is now available at
https://github.com/stesh/porick-flask

This repo is dead.
